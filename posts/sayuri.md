Efficiency and scalability are the cornerstones of successful Kubernetes workloads. In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital landscape, organizations require robust storage solutions seamlessly integrating with their Kubernetes environments. DigitalOcean [Spaces Object Storage](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces) has numerous benefits when paired with DigitalOcean Kubernetes like S3 compatible API, virtually limitless scalability, built-in CDN with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), native integration, up to 800 requests per second, and more. By combining the scalability, simplicity, and flexibility of Spaces with the power of Kubernetes, you can optimize your infrastructure, streamline workflows, and elevate the performance of your applications.

## Seamless integration

Spaces integrates natively with DigitalOcean Kubernetes, allowing you to leverage its powerful features and streamline your application workflows. By integrating one of the S3 SDKs into your Kubernetes application, you can mount Spaces as a storage bucket within your Kubernetes pods, enabling easy, shared access to object storage. The Spaces documentation includes a number of code examples for interacting with the files in your Spaces bucket.
