A recent report from Bloomberg News suggests that the successor to Nintendo's beloved video game console, the Nintendo Switch, is now slated for an early 2025 release. Previously, there had been speculations circulating that the new console, affectionately dubbed 'Nintendo Switch 2' by fans, would hit the shelves in 2024.

Following Nintendo's decision to postpone the launch of its Switch successor, which was communicated to video game developers, the company saw a significant decline in its shares, plummeting by as much as 8.8%.

While Nintendo has yet to provide official commentary on the development of a successor device, company President Shuntaro Furukawa highlighted during a recent earnings briefing that Nintendo remains committed to innovating new hardware and software. There is widespread speculation that the Japanese gaming giant is gearing up for the introduction of a new console to carry on the success of its aging yet still thriving Switch device.

Despite nearing its eighth year since release, the Nintendo Switch continues to enjoy robust sales. According to a recent report by IGN, the Nintendo Switch claimed the title of the third-best-selling video game console of all time by the close of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the console had amassed 139.36 million sales, trailing just 14.66 million units behind the Nintendo DS, the company's top-selling hardware.
